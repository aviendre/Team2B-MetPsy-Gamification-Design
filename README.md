# Project Title

MetPsy’s Gamification System

## Description

MetPsy is a cohort based online coaching platform recently launched by coaches Rachel Brown and Ally Houston. They are trained in the latest research and techniques in metabolic psychiatry (hence, named MetPsy). They develop personalised plans for people which includes dietary and lifestyle changes to help restore balance to their body’s metabolism and improve their mental health.

MetPsy want to engage the cohort beyond the live online sessions and events. They have been approached by healthcare professionals about having a free app version of the platform. Design an innovative gamification system for the MetPsy app that keeps users engaged beyond the lecture and peer-learning to make sure they benefit fully from the app using gamification. These changes should feed back into the functionality of the platform to ensure real world effect.
